I'm a second year postgraduate student from [School of Economics]([http://econ.ruc.edu.cn]), [Renmin University of China]([https://www.ruc.edu.cn/]). My main research interest is about how machine learning method can be used in environmental and resource economics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xuan Zhou]([http://econ.ruc.edu.cn/jszy/89fec4cc0b9d4180ace78e72edad10cf.html]) from [School of Economics]([http://econ.ruc.edu.cn]), [Renmin University of China]([https://www.ruc.edu.cn/]).
