## INTERN EXPERIENCE

### GuoJin Securities, Quantitative Research Intern
2023.08 - 2023.11

- Assisting analyst in using a fine-tuned FinGPT large language model to complete a text sentiment analysis project targeting specific financial forum comments.
- In the project, the deployment of the large language model and the fine-tuning of the corresponding parameters were carried out independently. The project developed strategies based on sentiment data, such as sentiment shifts, proportions of optimism and pessimism. The strategy backtest results showed an 8% excess annualized return in the A-share market.

### Shanghai Huanqing Technology, Quantitative Research Intern
2023.05 - 2023.08

- Led the liquidity forecasting project for interest rate bonds: Based on the main entities, bonds, and transaction data features (around 3 million records) from March 2023 to July 2023, machine learning methods such as random forests and spectral clustering were used to forecast the liquidity level of interest rate bonds. The prediction accuracy reached 60%.

### Shaanxi Changwu National Field Scientific Observation and Research Station for Agroecosystem
2022.01 - 2022.05

- Participated in the data analysis of the "Characteristics and Driving Mechanisms of the Microbial Carbon Pump in Eroding Environments" (general program funded by NSFC).
- Based on the measured data of soil physical and chemical properties as well as microbial abundance, the Girvan-Newman algorithm was used to identify the species near the sampling points. Furthermore, a BP neural network model was established to predict key abundance of key species based on indicators such as soil physical and chemical properties, providing data support for subsequent mechanism analysis.

## PROGRAM EXPERIENCE

### Cambridge AI+ Academic Program
2022.01 - 2022.03

- Successfully completed AI course and scientific research modules, earning an A- in comprehensive evaluation.
- Designed and implemented a project predicting microbial abundance based on soil properties, utilizing Principal Coordinates Analysis, Association Analysis, and Neural Network modeling techniques, and showcased the results.
- Among 12 participating teams, our team was recognized as the singular outstanding group and received recommendation letter from the project mentor, Professor Micheal Sutcliffe.

### UC Davis, Global Study Program
2023.01 - 2023.03

- Took courses in Algorithm & Computing, Discrete Math, and Operating System, overall GPA 4.0/4.0.
- During the exchange program, I took a course in Operating Systems and accomplished the following projects:
  1. Developed a simple command-line interpreter in C, supporting command parsing, built-in commands, input/output redirection, and employed pipelines for inter-process communication.
  2. Designed a user-level thread library based on C and queue data structures. This library implemented lightweight thread management in user space, allowing for thread creation, switching, and destruction. Successfully incorporated features for thread creation, scheduling, synchronization (including mutex locks, condition variables, and semaphores) as well as signal-based preemption disable/enable control.
